Title: Parallel Random Number Generation on GPU
Description: Builds on 'gpuR' and utilizes the 'clRNG' ('OpenCL') library to provide efficient tools to generate independent random numbers in parallel on a GPU and 
     save the results as 'R' objects, ensuring high-quality random numbers even when 'R' is used interactively or in an ad-hoc manner. 
     Includes Fisher's simulation method adapted from Patefield, William M (1981) <doi:10.2307/2346669> and 
     'MRG31k3p' Random Number Generator from 'clRNG' library by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (2015) <https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clRNG>.
